Chinese scientists have developed a plastic that degrades in seawater and could help curb the increasingly serious plastic pollution in the oceans.The new polyester composite material can decompose in seawater over a period ranging from a few days to several hundred days, leaving small molecules that cause no pollution, said Wang Gexia, a senior engineer at the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.For a long time, people focused on ¡¯white pollution¡¯ on land. Plastic pollution in the seas only caught people¡¯s attention when more and more reports about marine animals dying from it appeared in recent years, said Wang.Scientists combined non-enzymic hydrolysis, water dissolution and biodegradation processes to design and invent the new materialThe research was recently selected as one of 30 winning projects at a contest of innovative future technologies in Shenzhen, south China¡¯s Guangdong Province. The contest encouraged young Chinese scientists to conceive groundbreaking technologies and trigger innovation.China has given top priority to ecological environmental protection, contributing Chinese wisdom to resolving global pollution.
